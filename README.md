# 🎭 Multimodal Emotion Recognition

**Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER)** is a system designed to detect human emotions using multiple input modalities such as **facial expressions, speech, and text**.  
It combines **deep learning models** and **feature fusion techniques** to provide accurate and robust emotion predictions.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This project leverages multiple sources of human communication to recognize emotions more accurately than single-modality systems.  
It processes and combines data from:

- 🎥 **Facial Expressions**: Uses images/video frames to detect emotions.
- 🗣️ **Speech/Audio**: Extracts features like MFCCs, spectrograms, and voice tone.
- 💬 **Text**: Analyses textual sentiment (optional in some datasets).

The system applies **feature extraction**, **deep learning models** (CNN, LSTM, Transformers), and **fusion techniques** to make multimodal emotion predictions.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎭 Detects core emotions: **Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Neutral**
- 🔊 Supports **speech/audio-based emotion recognition**
- 📸 Supports **facial-expression-based emotion recognition**
- 💬 Supports **text-based emotion analysis**
- 🤝 **Multimodal fusion** for improved accuracy
- ⚡ Real-time predictions (optional, depending on hardware)
